# Search Enhancer

A lightweight Chrome extension that tries to bring back the good old Google Search experience by removing the **AI Overview** box – the part that’s often useless, misleading, or just in the way.  

I’ll keep updating this extension as long as it’s useful to me. Feel free to open issues or suggest improvements.

### Limitations
- **Chrome only** — I don’t currently use other browsers.
- AI Overview is removed **after** it loads, so you may see a flash of it before it disappears.
- May not work on all search engines or in all regions.
- Like any extension that pokes at Google’s DOM, it can break whenever they change layouts.
